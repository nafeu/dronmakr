## Made Using `dronmakr`

- [Ember Proxima - Ambient Drone Pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcgXYEDiIHc)
- Parts of the [Primordialis OST](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011360/Primordialis/)

## Installation & Setup

#### Requirements
- Python `3.10+`, (the project was built in Python `3.10.16`)
- macOS (might work on PC but I have not tested it, contributors welcome!)
- a VST3 or Audio Units library with a few working instruments and effects


```sh
git clone https://github.com/nafeu/dronmakr.git
cd dronmakr
```

Setup Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure your environment variables

```
cp .env-sample .env
```

Fill in the `.env` with relevant values, the following is an example:

```
PLUGIN_PATHS="/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components,/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST,/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3"
ASSERT_INSTRUMENT="Reaktor 6"
IGNORE_PLUGINS=""
CUSTOM_PLUGINS=""
```

## Usage

### 0. Verify the CLI is installed

### 3. View Your Samples in the Auditioner

`python dronmakr.py server`

Open `http://0.0.0.0:3766` in a browser window.

## Project Limitations

This project is built ontop of [pedalboard.io](https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/reference/pedalboard.io.html) which is a python wrapper on the [JUCE framework](https://juce.com/). There are [known compatibility issues](https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/reference/pedalboard.html#pedalboard.VST3Plugin) with many VST and AU plugins. Some of the ones that I've been able to get working are as follows:

_* All testing was done on `macOS Sequoia 15.1` on an `Apple M4 Pro` machine._

| Plugin Name | VST3 Works | AU Works
| --- | --- | --- |
| Massive | Yes | ? |
| FM8 | Yes | ? |
| Reaktor 6 | Yes | ? |
| Replika | Yes | ? |
| Raum | Yes | ? |
| Vital | Yes | ? |
| Phasis | Yes | ? |
| Saltygrain | No | Yes |

Additionally, I haven't been able to figure out how to preview audio directly from the instrument when adding presets, as a workaround, you can press the `spacebar` in your terminal window while a plugin is open in the editor and a preview sample will be exported and played in the background.

> Where are my samples stored once generated?

Initially, all audio is stored in the `exports` folder and all generated MIDI is stored in `midi`. When using the auditioner, you can move samples into the `saved` or `trash` folders.

> "Reaktor 6" is being recognized as an effect instead of an instrument, what do I do?

You can use the `ASSERT_INSTRUMENT` env var to list any plugins that you want to launch strictly as an *instrument*
